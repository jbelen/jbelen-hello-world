Hello World project for GitHub

Initial try to be GitHub Knowledgeable

Created a REPOSITORY, then a new BRANCH (a copy/different version of a repository). 

The original Branch is called master.

We call changes to the new branch as COMMITS

IMPORTANT : Best Practice to always include COMMIT MESSAGE (to describe the changes done)
